# RichFlex — DIY Starter (Flutter, iOS & Android)

This starter shows a premium, “useless” luxury app (image + bold statement) with EN/AR localization,
edition selector, simple ownership certificate (local only), and stubs for in‑app purchases (IAP).

> You will **create the Flutter project yourself**, then copy these files to replace the defaults.

---

## 0) Prerequisites (Mac or Windows)

- Install **Git** (optional but recommended).
- Install **Flutter SDK**: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
- Install **Android Studio** (Android SDK + emulator) and/or **Xcode** (for iOS on macOS).
- Create developer accounts:
  - **Apple Developer Program** (99 USD/year)
  - **Google Play Console** (25 USD one-time)
- (Optional) Create a brand/domain + email for Support and Privacy Policy pages.

---

## 1) Create the Flutter project

```bash
flutter create rich_flex_app
cd rich_flex_app
```

### Replace/add files

Copy the contents of this starter pack into your new project (accept overwrite), keeping the Flutter auto-generated files.
Place folders as follows:

- `lib/` → replace existing `lib/`
- `assets/` → new folder
- `l10n/` → new folder
- `pubspec.yaml` → overwrite with the one provided here (then run `flutter pub get`).

---

## 2) Packages & assets

Run:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

If you later add real purchases:
```bash
flutter pub add in_app_purchase
```

---

## 3) Run the app locally

Android:
```bash
flutter run -d emulator-5554  # or choose your device from `flutter devices`
```

iOS (macOS only):
```bash
open -a Simulator
flutter run -d ios
```

---

## 4) Configure app name & icons

- Change the app name (in `pubspec.yaml` under `flutter_launcher_name` or directly in each platform project).
- Generate icons with `flutter_launcher_icons` (already in `pubspec.yaml`). Update `assets/app_icon.png` if you add your own.
  Then run:
```bash
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```

> We included a basic 1024×1024 `assets/app_icon.png` as a placeholder.

---

## 5) Enable Arabic (RTL) + English

Already wired. Switch in **Settings** screen.

---

## 6) (Optional) Add real In‑App Purchases

1. **Create products** in App Store Connect / Google Play Console (non‑consumables, e.g., `edition_black_diamond`, `edition_emerald`, `edition_sapphire`).
2. Add the `in_app_purchase` package:
   ```bash
   flutter pub add in_app_purchase
   ```
3. Follow platform setup guides (billing permission on Android, StoreKit config on iOS).
4. Replace `lib/iap/iap.dart` with real purchase logic (we left a clear TODO section).
5. Test in sandbox / internal testing tracks **before** going live.

---

## 7) Build for release

### Android (AAB)
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
```
Upload the `.aab` to **Google Play Console** (Production).

### iOS (IPA / App Store)
Open the iOS module in Xcode (generated by Flutter) and follow archive/upload steps, or:
```bash
flutter build ipa --release
```
Then use Xcode’s Organizer to upload to **App Store Connect**.

---

## 8) Store listing checklist (Dubai‑first)

- **Languages**: English (US), Arabic (UAE). Keep the tone fun but respectful.
- **Pricing**: Paid app + very expensive IAP (editions). Set AED pricing high.
- **Description**: Be transparent: “This app has no practical utility — it’s a luxury statement.”
- **Screenshots**: Use the app’s Diamond/Emerald/Sapphire screens.
- **Privacy**: If no analytics & no remote server → declare “No data collected” (Apple) / “No data shared or collected” (Play).

---

## 9) Files included here

- `lib/` — Flutter app code (screens, localization, IAP stub).
- `assets/images/` — Placeholder gem images.
- `l10n/` — EN/AR localization files.
- `pubspec.yaml` — Ready for assets + localization + icons.
- `PrivacyPolicy.md` & `Terms.md` — Minimal legal pages (edit with your brand/email).

---

## 10) Next steps & ideas

- Add **limited drops** (time-limited editions).
- Add **“Show‑Off Mode”** (keeps screen awake + max brightness).
- Add **widgets** (iOS/Android) to pin the gem on home screen.
- Consider a **one‑page website** for credibility + press.

Good luck — ship it fast, iterate later 🚀
